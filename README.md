This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page reloads when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about running tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run deploy`
Deploys the `build` folder to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages`.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation.** Once you eject, you can’t go back!  
Only use this if you need to customize the default Webpack or Babel configs.
